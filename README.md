My playground for testing the various dependency injection methods/frameworks for scala

Cakelike Pattern:
+Compile time check if injection is bound
+Classes are not really injection aware
-Hard to understand

Subcut
+Quit easy
-Classes are injection aware, need to implement a trait and have an implicit constructor parameter
